	<p>Have you ever heard of poutine?  Well, now you have!  It's delicious.  Poutine is made with french fries, which are then topped with a gravy-like sauce and cheese curds.  It's actually not a Toronto food, but rather a Canadian dish.  I was surprised to see that even the Wendy's in Toronto serve poutine.  You won't find that in the United States.</p>

	<p>The great part about food in Toronto is that you're not stuck with only a few options.  Because of the diversity of the city, every cultural area has its own delicious food vendors.  Craving Italian food tonight?  Check out Little Italy.  Perhaps Greek is what you are in the mood for?  Then head over to Greektown.  In fact, Greektown has an annual food festival called "Taste of the Danforth" thats held during the summer.</p>
