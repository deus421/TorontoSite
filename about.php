	<h1>About Design</h1>
	<h2>Content</h2>
	<p>I think that I have some pretty good content on this website.  Pretty much everything that I talked about is from personal experience.  Almost all the places that I mentioned I have been to at some point.  I tried not to just google random places and write about them.  The pictures I had to use from online because I don't have pictures from everywhere I went to, but I wrote about my experience.</p> 
	<h2>Navigation</h2>
	<p>I believe that my navigation accomplishes everything that it is supposed to do.  I dont have too many links in my global nav (only 6).  I dont have a local navigation, but I dont feel like I need one.  The user can get to any page of my website in one click from the global navigation.  I also clearly display what page the user is on, so hopefuly no one will get lost.</p>
	<h2>Organization</h2>
	<p>My site is fairly well organized.  Everything makes logical sense.  I have a home page which is the home of the site, provides a brief overview.  I have an about page which lists some quick facts and a map of the city.  Then I grouped tour and nightlife under one category, do.  I made the assumption that the audience of my site will be people around my age, mainly students, that will be interested in either touring a city, or interested about the nightlife of a city.  I have a consume page, which is about foods and drinks in the city.  Then I have a events page, which lists some well known/big events that some people will recognize.  Finally, I have a plan page so that the user can get some quick info on how to plan a trip to Toronto.</p>
	<h2>Design</h2>
	<p>I followed most the design principles that we learned in class.  I tried to make the color scheme relevent, hence the blue and red that I used.  The dark blue color is the same color on the toronto flag, then I used a ligher blue color to make the content pop with a white background.  I kept most the concent and important headings to the left side of the page, as that is where the viewers eyes are most focused.  I added a shadow around the main content too in order to make it appear less "flat".  I made the banner in photoshop.  The font that I used for the logo is actually the same typeface that the Toronto Transit Comission uses on its trains/documents.  Then I just chose a google font that popped out at me for the content of the site.  Overall, I dont think I strayed from general design principles very far.</p>
	<h2>HTML/CSS</h2>
	<p>I used all the normal HTML/CSS conventions.  I made sure that my site validated to HTML5 standards.  I commented my CSS as well.  I used server side includes for the navigation to minimize repeated code.</p>
	<h1>For Final</h1>
	<h2>JavaScript/DHTML</h2>
	<p>My Original JavaScript component is the image slideshow that I have on the front page.  This is also my DHTML component.  The images in this gallery switch by themselves, but the user can also go backwards or forwards in the gallery by pressing on the arrows that I created and put on either side of the slideshow.</p>
	<h2>Corrections from Project 1</h2>
	<p>I pretty much corrected everything.  I changed the one typo that I had.  I changed the navigation as suggested, so that the title of my site now displays along with the title of the page.  I changed the "Events" page to be another verb, to stay consistant with the naming of my other pages.  I swapped the pages under the "Do" dropdown menu so they are now consistant with the rest of the pages in that style.  As far as the margin goes, I decided to try to give the website a more "flatter" look and got rid of the shadows, and made the header strech across the entire page.  I changed the font size of the subheadings in my menu to easier help users identify a hierarchy.  All repeated code is now in php.</p>
	<h2>Extras</h2>
	<p>Extra 1: I added an animation to scrolling over the navigation menu bar.  This is done using a JavaScript library called "animate.css".<br/>  Extra 2: Added a favicon. <br/> Extra 3: Added a google maps interactive map on the about page, instead of the map that I had before.  This map always starts out centered around Toronto.  I also added a few markers to the map using the Google Maps API.  The markers on the map are locations that I talk about in my site.  If you hover over the marker it will tell you the location that the marker is on.
