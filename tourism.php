		<p>The Toronto Zoo is a must see for anyone visiting Toronto.  The Toronto Zoo is the largest Zoo in all of Canada encompassing 710 acres!  Let me tell you, thats a lot of animals.  The Zoo is laid out by being split into seven different geographic areas representing animals from all around the world.  In total, the zoo has over 5000 animals.  If you're planning on making a visit to the Zoo, be prepared for it to be a day long adventure. </p>
	<h1>CN Tower</h1>

		<p>Perhaps one of the most distinguishing features of the Toronto skyline, and even Toronto itself, is the CN tower.  When the tower was built in 1976 it was the worlds tallest free-standing structure.  Today, it is the worlds 6th tallest free-standing structure.  The view from the observation deck at the top of this tower is spectacular.  You get a clear view of the entire city, and out across the lake.  A really neat feature of the tower is that it has a glass floor observation deck too.  Let me tell you, it's quite spooky to be staring almost 1,200 feet straight down, and standing on glass.  Definitely an experience that I would recommend for anyone in Toronto.</p>
	<h1>Hockey Hall of Fame</h1>

		<p>Are you a fan of hockey?  Of course you are!  The Hockey Hall of Fame is conveniently located in downtown Toronto.  It has a bunch of really sweet exhibits that even non-hockey fans (There are people that don't like hockey?) would enjoy.  The Stanley Cup is usually on display, as well as other neat NHL memorabilia and equipment.</p>
