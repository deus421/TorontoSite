		<p>My favorite place on earth is Toronto!  Now, I know what you're thinking, "But its so cold there, its CANADA!", and thats where you're right! (At least 70% of the year).  But thats what makes Toronto so special.  It's an awesome city with awesome people.  Toronto has a ton of things to do all year round, and it is home to several world renound events and festivals.  Toronto is also a great place to go to for concerts and musical events.

		Two years ago, my buddies and I went to see Swedish House Mafia at Rogers Centre.  The picture to the right is of us inside the Rogers Centre, its HUGE!  Rogers Centre is a great venue for events simply because of how massive it is.  If there's ever a big music tour to hit Toronto, you can be sure that it will be in Rogers Centre.  Rogers Centre is just one out of many great places to visit while in Tornto.
