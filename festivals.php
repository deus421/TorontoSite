	<p>The Toronto International Film Festival is held annually in September.  It is on the same level of popularity and importance as the Cannes and Sundance film festivals.  I personally have not been to the TIFF yet, but being a huge movie guy, I would love to go sometime.  The festival has recently made a move to focus more on independent cinema.</p>

	<p>North by Northeast is an annual music festival that is held every June in Toronto.  You may have heard of the slightly more popular festival, South by Southwest (SXSW) which is held in Texas annualy.  NXNE is modeled after SXSW.  It takes place over several days all over downtown bars and clubs.  Many of the venues are grouped up around the same areas, including College Street.
