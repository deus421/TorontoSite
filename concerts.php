	<h1>Concerts</h1>
	<p>Toronto is a great city for concerts because of the amount of venues it has available.  From the huge Rogers Centre to all the small bars and nightclubs, there is live music entertainment every night of all sorts.  What makes Toronto even more awesome in terms of concerts is that because of how culturally diverse the city is, there are concerts of all types of genres.  Are you feeling adventurous and don't know what you are in the mood for?  Then go downtown and just hit up a random bar.  Chances are very high that on a weekend night there will be some sort of live entertainment.  Want to see something more mainstream and popular?  Then check out the Rogers Centre's upcoming events.  The Centre mostly features huge acts because of how big the venue is.  Are you in your cowboy hat and boots and in the mood for some whiskey?  Check out the Dakota Tavern.  The Tavern is host to country and blues shows throughout the year.</p>

	<p>Rogers Centre is a stadium in downtown toronto, right next to the CN Tower.  It is the biggest indoor concert venue in Toronto.  Throughout the year it is also home to baseball and football games.  Fun fact, the Buffalo Bills have also played in this stadium on several occasions.  My friends and I saw Swedish House Mafia here, and it was a blast.  The scale of the centre doesnt really hit until you are inside.  It's crazy huge.</p>
