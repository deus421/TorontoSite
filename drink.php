	<p>Mullins is a little Irish pub that I got to experience on a Saturday night.  It has a nice, relaxing type of atmosphere.  Definitely more calm and way less "clubby" than other places around.  My friends and I had a drink called an "Irish Car Bomb" when we were there.  I would highly recommend trying it.  It's a shot of Jameson and Baily's dropped into a glass of Guiness.  Delicious!</p>

	<p>With a name like "Eat My Martini" I have a hard time admitting I went there, but honestly it was a pretty cool place.  The drinks there were quite cheap for a Saturday night because they were having a happy hour.  It's a small bar with loud music and dim lights, but a nice place to just hang out and relax on a weekend night.</p>
