	<h1>Nightlife</h1>
	<p>Toronto nightlife is awesome.  Toronto has one of the most diverse music scenes in the world.  Want to get your party on?  Not 21 yet? NO PROBLEM!  The legal drinking age in Toronto is 19!  Head down to College Street.  The entire area is filled with bars and clubs that will appeal to mostly the 18-25 year old crowd.  Conveniently located near the University of Toronto, College Street is the place to be to get crunk on the weekends.  People still say "crunk" right?  My friends and I went down to college street to bar hop and we had a great time.  What's really nice is that there are a good number of bars and clubs that do not charge a cover fee.  This makes it great for hopping around and exploring all the bars and clubs that Toronto has to offer.  Be prepared though, as in any big city, drinks do cost quite a bit of money.  Great public transportation also makes it easy to have fun and stay safe.</p>
	<h1>The Guvernment</h1>
	<p>"The Guv" is Toronto's biggest and most popular nigtclub.  It is huge.  When I say huge, I mean not just one nightclub, but a whole complex that has 8 individual rooms inside it with DJ's and a dance floor in every room.  It has a capacity of 7000.  Let me tell you, thats one big party.  The club is also host to world renound DJ's such as Deadmou5, Avicii, Tiesto, and many others.  In 2008, DJ Mag rated the complex as number 8 best nightclub in the world.  I would recommend going here only if you are seriously in the mood to go partying.  This place is extremely energetic and packed on the weekends.  Definitely not for the faint of heart.</p>
