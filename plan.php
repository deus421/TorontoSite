	<h1>Plan</h1>
	<p>It's very easy to plan a trip to Toronto.  Toronto is within a 90-minute flight for 60% of the United States population. It's a very easy city to navigate around too, due to the grid type layout that it has.</p>

	<p>Public transportation is great in Toronto.  The Toronto Transit Comission (TTC) serves the city with busses, trains, and streetcars.  You only need to pay one fair, and can use any mode of transportation.  I would recommend getting a day pass when vising, as it makes it very easy to get around the city without having to worry about paying everytime you need to use the subway or bus.  Plus, the Toronto subway is called "The Rocket".</p>
	<h1>Stay</h1>

	<p>Toronto has plenty of hotels.  As is expected, the farther away from the city the hotel is, the more cheaper it will be.  Price's per night are not too bad though, it is affortable.  There are also some nice hotels right along southern Toronto, next to Lake Ontario that have a nice view.</p>
