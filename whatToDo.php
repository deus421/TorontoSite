		<p>There are a plethora of fun and interesting places to visit in Toronto.  One of the most iconic buildings in the Toronto skyline is the CN Tower.  The view at the top of the tower is crazy cool, and I recommend everyone go check it out.  I would also recommend visiting the Toronto Zoo, and the Hockey Hall of Fame.  The only problem is finding enough time to explore everything.</p>

		<p>Toronto has a superb nightlife scene.  You will find clubs that host big parties with world renound Dj's as well as laid back pubs and lounges where you can relax over a few drinks.  Toronto also makes it easy to have a fun and safe night out because of public transportation and good layout. </p>
